## **Quick start**

This guide will show you how to quickly initialize, create, and deploy your subgraph with X1's Subgraph service. By deploying the subgraph, you can explore the subgraph GraphQL API by issuing queries and viewing the schema.

The X1 testnet currently provides a **beta version** of the Subgraph **Hosted Service**. To deploy a subgraph on this service, please send your application to subgraph@okx.com and include the following information:

Here's an example to help you get started with the X1 Graph. For more development details, please refer to https://github.com/okx-subgraph/xlayer-subgraph-example/tree/main/docs.

We will notify you once the subgraph is successfully deployed, and you can check your subgraph data at the following links:
> Query URL: https://www.okx.com/api/v1/x1-testnet/index/subgraphs/name/<Subgraph_name>  
> Query Playground: https://www.okx.com/api/v1/x1-testnet/index/subgraphs/name/<Subgraph_name>/graphql  
> Please replace <Subgraph_name> in the examples with your own subgraph name.
